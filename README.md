## Description

You Get a Tech Blog! is a simple CMS Web platform for managing your own blog, along with other users doing their own blogs as well. Your posts are all available at the same location, creating a conent source for many voices at the same time!

I built You Get a Tech Blog! because I like simplicity. Too many Web apps get so feature-rich that they become confusing to use. I wanted something for this purpose that is, well, simple. You Get a Tech Blog! puts up almost no hurdles between you and the act of publishing.

## Installation Instructions

As a user, you interact with You Get a Tech Blog! through your web browser of choice, it's as simple as that. There are no other installations necessary on your computer, phone or tablet. You will need to have Javascript enabled to use the app.


## Usage Information

The home page of You Get a Tech Blog! is a list of the most recent ten posts by all users of the site, ordered chronologically starting with the most recent. Each is shown with its headline, author and publish date. Clicking on the "see all posts" link at the bottom of the home page takes you to the entire list of all published articles.

Anywhere you see the author of a post, that name will be clickable to show a list of all posts by that user, each with a publish date. Anywhere you see a link to a headline, click it to view the contents of the post an all comments that have been left.

Anyone, registered user or not, may read any posts on the site, but in order to create any content yourself--either posts or comments--you will need to have a user account or log in. Click the "Log in" link in the main navigation. You can create an account by providing a unique username, unique email address and a password. If you already have an account, log in with your username and password.

Once logged in, you can create content. Use the "Dashboard" link in the main navigation to come to a list of your own posts, and where you'll find a link to "Make a new post". Click that link for a simple form. Provide a title and content (both required) and click "Post" to publish.

Back on the Dashboard, you will find "edit" and "delete" links for each of your posts: click on either for the expected function.

## Credits

This site was coded by Lee Klusky (that's me!). But as usual, I could not have done it without the guidance and boilerplate code from the staff of the University of Minnesota Full Stack Coding Boot Camp. I also found a lot of help from the writers and commenters on websites like [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com), the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.com) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com). This software was written on a backend using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Express](https://www.expressjs.com), and [Sequelize](https://www.sequelize.org). The front end was styled using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).
